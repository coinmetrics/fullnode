# Unofficial fullnode images

This is unofficial fullnode images of various blockchains by Coin Metrics.

These images are being used internally at Coin Metrics, and are published in the hope they will be useful, but without any warranty.
No support is available. You are using them at your own risk.

This repository is **new**, **experimental**, and **work in progress**. If you want more stable experience, please consider the [Fullnodes](https://gitlab.com/coinmetrics/fullnodes) group of repositories by Coin Metrics, which is still maintained.

## Features

* Built from sources, no official binaries used
* [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)-based
* Include very minimal set of dependencies, just enough to run a node
* Rebuilt regularly with latest versions of dependencies
* Intended for analytical purposes. Features like wallet/GUI are excluded if possible

## Source

Build scripts repo: https://github.com/coinmetrics/fullnode
